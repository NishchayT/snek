> **_Adding `[]` next to the variable identifier will make it a x array variable (x can be any datatype.)_**

> Example:
>
> ```c
>   // I am a character, I'm not powerful enough to store more than one character ):
>   char a = 'A';
>   // I am a char array and I have the power to store multiple characters in me.
>   char b[] = "Abc";
> ```
> *These variables are called arrays.*
