# Variables

## Uses of variables:
1) If you have to use some value repeatedly, you can use variables instead.
2) Variables are used to store data.
3) You can store data of multiple types (char, int, float, double, etc...).
4) Save the value once and use it as many times as per your wish!
5) Modify 'em whenever you want*. (*constants cannot be modified)
